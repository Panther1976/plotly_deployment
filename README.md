## Overview of the Project: 

The purpose of this project was to help Roza add to her dashboardâ€™s demographic information with visualizations of the data for each volunteer. To do this we added a gauge chart that displays the belly button washing frequency, a bar chart that displays the top 10 bacteria cultures found and a bubble chart that shows the number of bacteria cultures found per sample.
